            <strong style="font-size: 40px">It all starts with a new device.</strong><br>
            The experience of buying a new device fills one's body with endorphins and seretonin,
            a.k.a happiness and excitement. The climax, is that, a climax because after that the excitement fades
            and one is left with nothing but the memory of what it felt like.

            As the days pass, we start to care less about the phone and more about something that
            we don't have. After a few months our so called “new” phone will become the old phone
            which you will plan to sell or give away in order to get the newer devices.
